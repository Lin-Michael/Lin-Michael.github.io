                        <h3>Embedded Software Engineering Intern | Ignis Innovations</h3>
                        <p>Ignis Innovations is a startup founded in 2000 which does cutting edge research on OLED display technology. <br>
                           OLED displays promise high resolutions and vivid brightness, however one of the problems with it is that the <br>
                           diodes tend to wear out over time, making the screen have an uneven brightness distribution. A solution to this <br>
                           problem that this company has done pioneering research in is to track the burn out in each pixel and compensate<br>
                           for the loss by supplying the individual pixel with a higher voltage.</p>
                           <p>As an Embedded intern, my job was to develop apply the data gathering and compensation algorithms on a <br>
                            variety of devices to prove its feasibility. Some of the platforms I worked on include Android phones,<br>
                            linux, Windows, xilinx UltraScale and custom display PCBs. I helped to develop a windows application that <br>
                            displays a video and tracks OLED burn in over time. My internship cut short in late March due to the coronavirus <br>
                            outbreak, however I was happy with my experience because I was able to work on meaningful projects while<br>
                            learning new technologies.

                        <h3>Automation Systems Designer | ATS Automation</h3>
                        <p>Automation Tooling Systems (ATS) is a global manufacturer of manufacturing automation. It has provides services <br>
                            for various industries including Life Sciences, Nuclear and Energy, Automotive and more. ATS distinguishes itself<br>
                           from its competitors by offering a patented linear inductance SuperTrak conveyor belt system allowing for faster cycle <br>
                          times and less stations.</p>
                        <p>As a systems design intern in the life sciences division, I helped out with several ongoing projects at various stages <br>
                            in their design lifecycle. The systems department's role at ATS is to bridge the gap between the other departments including <br>
                            Mechanical, Applications (technical sales) and Controls and solve the problems that require the expertise from a combination<br>
                            of the departments. Due to the nature of the job, I was able to learn a great deal about the production of an automated line.
                            I assisted the Applications Engineering team in creating technical proposals by referring to the previous projects to facilitate 
                            design reuse. For projects in early stages design and development, I created process cycletime estimations by using excel 
                            worksheets and robot-arm simulation software. One of my major tasks was to conduct a proof of principle study on an aseptic
                             manufacturing process involving highly fragile products. For another project, I was asked to troubleshoot a manufacturing line
                            by performing a tolerance analysis on a micron precise part. Finally, I helped out with the factory acceptance testing of a line
                            to ensure that it met the contract requirements. </p>
                            <p>Overall, I was learned a lot about the automation industry and several of the problems that the industry typically deals with.</p>
